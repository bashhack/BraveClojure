; 1) Write a function that takes a string as an argument and searches for it on
; Bing and Google using the `slurp` function. Your function should return the
; HTML of the first page returned by the search.

; 2) Update your function so it takes a second argument consisting of the
; search engines to use.

; 3) Create a new function that takes a search term and search engines as
; arguments, and returns a vector of the URLs from the first page of search
; results from each search engine.
