;; Clojure Exercises (from Chapter 5, 'Functional Programming')

; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; "One of the best ways to develop your functional programming skills is to try
; to implement existing functions. To that end, most of the following exercises
; suggest a function fo you to implement, but don't stop there; go through the
; Clojure cheat sheet (`http://clojure.org/cheatsheet/`) and pick more!



; (1) You used `(comp :intelligence :attributes)` to create a function that
; returns a character's intelligence. Create a new function, `attr`, that you
; can call like `(attr :intelligence)` and that does the same thing.


; (2) Implement the `comp` function.

; (3) Implement the `assoc-in` function. Hint: use the `assoc` function and
; defin its parameters as `[m [k & ks] v]`.

; (4) Look up and use the `update-in` function.

; (5) Implement `update-in`.
